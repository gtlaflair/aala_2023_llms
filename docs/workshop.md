## Examples

### One

You are a biology expert. Write a passage about bioluminescence that meets four criteria:

It is three paragraphs long
It contains examples of both plants and animals
It is written at a high school level


Write a multiple choice question vocabulary question based about the meaning of bioluminescence using plain language

Example:
What is bacteria?

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Possible bad answer:
Bacteria are microbes with a cell structure simpler than that of many other organisms

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Possible good answer:
Very small living things, or “bugs,” that can be helpful (they help to digest food) or can cause illness (strep throat, for example).


### Two

You are an expert in elementary education. You will write an essay about the benefits and drawbacks of homework. Your essay will have the following content:

An introduction to the topic
